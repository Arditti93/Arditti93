## Hey there I'm Alex, Welcome to my GitHub 

### I'm developing my coding skills all the time and I'm especially interested in React and front end development. I'm also keen on Python and Java script 

### Having studied hard during lockdown on a Master Coding immersive bootcamp with Code Nation; I am determined to use these skills to start a new career in coding and developing. ### Iâ€™m inspired to continue to develop and expand these skills further.
